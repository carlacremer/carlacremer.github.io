I'm a DPhil student in the [Human Information Processing Lab](https://humaninformationprocessing.com/) of Professor Chris Summerfield at the University of Oxford. 

Previously, I was a Winter Scholar at the [Centre for the Governance of AI](https://www.governance.ai/), an affiliated researcher at the [Centre for the Study of Existential Risk](https://www.cser.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, a research scholar (RSP) at the FHI in Oxford and a visitor to the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence in Cambridge](http://lcfi.ac.uk/). 

I studied in Bristol, Munich and Zurich, trained in labs like [this](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/zfinch.html) and [this](https://cogneuro.bio.lmu.de/) one.

These drawings of me are playful creations by humans and algorithms; namely Magdalena Adomeit, Lars Laichter and DALL-E.
