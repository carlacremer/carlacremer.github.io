I’m a research scholar (RSP) at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford and a research affiliate at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge.

From October 2021 onwards I’ll be an FHI DPhil scholar, working in the Human Information Processing Lab of Professor Chris Summerfield at Oxford.

Keywords that describe my research interests: existential risk, global catastrophic risk, deep learning, computational neuroscience, democratic technology assessments
