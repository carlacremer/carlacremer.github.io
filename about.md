I'm an FHI DPhil scholar, working in the [Human Information Processing Lab](https://humaninformationprocessing.com/) of Professor Chris Summerfield at the University of Oxford. I'm also an affiliated researcher at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge.

Previously, I was a research scholar (RSP) at the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) at Oxford. 

I was educated in Bristol, Munich and Zurich, trained in labs like [this](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/zfinch.html) and [this](https://cogneuro.bio.lmu.de/) one.
